So each of the animations are 8 frames and would prolly look 
best at 300ms framerate. 

I think 1st storyboard, looped. Then player hits any key
zoomed 1st storyboard looped, any key
2nd storyboard looped, any key
fade out, change to 3rd storyboard looped, fade in, any key
game start. 

----------------
In the background folder, I have the looped 8 frame Title screen.

I placed in buttons as well, so prolly just place the original buttons
invisible and placed over the animated background. Also a fade out and
/fade into first storyboard
