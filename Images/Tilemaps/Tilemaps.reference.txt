Ideally there will be seperate files for each of the tilemaps described below.
Currently used files FloorTilemap, MainTilemap, and PitTiles are not ideal.

Ideal Tilemaps:
    1. WalkTilemap.png     - All 32x32 tiles that can be walked over by character/enemies.
    2. PitTilemap.png      - These 32x32 tiles should kill enemies/character and be able to be walked into.
    3. TraverseTilemap.png - The 32x32 tiles should be able to be passed by using the grapple or by flying enemies.
                             The character will be unable to walk into them and the character dies if they land in them.
    4. WallTilemap.png     - These should be multiple seperate files of 32x64 that can be grabbed by the grapple.
    5. BlockTilemap.png    - These 32x32 tiles should be impassable by enemies/character and not grabbable by the grapple.
